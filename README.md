# WebWord

Unmodified WebWord code from: https://moonshotai.github.io/Kimi-K2/thinking.html (saved with "Open Frame In New Tab" on Firefox)

I did not make this. This was allegedly made by a single prompt by Kimi K2 Thinking. Looks like it's in plain JS and no framework or dependency used for either the UI or the application logic.

Content is only saved locally in Local Storage in the browser; document import and export works via HTML format. To save to PDF, use Print. Will work offline.
